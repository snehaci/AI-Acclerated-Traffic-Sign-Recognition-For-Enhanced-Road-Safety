# AI-Acclerated-Traffic-Sign-Recognition-For-Enhanced-Road-Safety

Traffic Sign Recognition is a critical application for safe driving for drivers as well as in autonomous driving systems, providing the ability for vehicles to detect and classify road signs in real-time. The system proposed in this project leverages deep learning, particularly CNN, to accurately classify traffic signs. Using the CNN-based approach in TensorFlow and Keras to train a model that recognizes and classifies traffic signs into their respective categories. The system includes several steps, including data preprocessing, model design, training, evaluation, and model saving for future predictions. This outlines the process of building this traffic sign recognition system, detailing the algorithms and methods used to achieve high accuracy. The project presents a graphical user interface (GUI) for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for traffic sign recognition and testing it by uploading images. The CNN is built using TensorFlow and trained on the GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark) dataset. This system assists in automatically identifying traffic signs in images, which can be useful for autonomous driving technologies. The system includes a model training interface, prediction mechanism, and image uploading feature, all integrated into a user-friendly desktop application developed using the Tkinter framework. The system can be used for real-time traffic sign detection, supporting autonomous driving systems and enhancing road safety.
